        the name of a vector data contained in the source product. If the source product does not contain
        this kind of data, the user should create it previously by creating a new vector data container and adding
        some areas by using the available tools (Rectangle, Polygon or Ellipse drawing tools)</td>

        <td><strong>referenceBands</strong></td>
        <td>The NIR band to be used as reference. It should have the same raster size than the source bands selected.
            If the source bands have different raster sizes, it should be selected at least one reference band per each raster size.
            If they are selected two or more reference bands with the same raster size, only the first of them will be used for the correction.

    <tr>
        <td><strong>minNIRString</strong></td>
        <td>If the user sets an only value, this value will be used for all reference bands selected. It is possible to use individual values
        for each reference band by separating them by ';'. If the value is negative, then the minimum in the NIR band over the sample area will
        be used.</td>
